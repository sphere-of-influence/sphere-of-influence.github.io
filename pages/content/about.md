Sphere of Influence is dedicated to tracking lefty news on Twitter with a focus on the United Kingdom. 
Contributors wanted! We are currently in Beta so things might be a little rough & ready.

Current contributors are [@SleepingInSnow](//twitter.com/SleepingInSnow) and [@OldNewStandard](//twitter.com/OldNewStandard). If you'd like to join the team please contact either of us.

## Goal

Sphere of Influence aims to spread optimism and awareness of the Labour Movement.

## How does this work?

Content is ephemeral, meaning only the latest stories from contributors are displayed. For archived content please 
refer to the individual contributor Twitter feeds.

We're currently in early development so things will often break and some news may be irrelevant or confusing.

If something is a country level event, eg. affecting the whole UK, a random town will be bestowed the honour of "hosting" the story.

We use GitHub Pages for hosting the front-end and Heroku for providing the back-end. Open Layers and Open Street Map provide the mapping interface technology. Chiefly written in JavaScript and Python.

For technical details you can read the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/bogstandard/Sphere-of-Influence).

## Issues, Inaccuracies or Concerns 
If you've concerns about the content on Sphere of Influence, please contact a contributor. All concerns will be promptly addressed.

### Previous Works

Sphere of Influence is a super-light rebuild of a concept originally realised by [@OldNewStandard](//twitter.com/OldNewStandard) with his [Atlaski Project](https://folio.brighton.ac.uk/user/eric-daddio/atlaski-stories-mapped) for the University of Brighton.
