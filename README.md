# Sphere of Influence (Platform)

Sphere of Influence is a barebones distributed platform for mapping curated news on Twitter. 

The front-end is as light as possible and the back-end is a stateless RESTful API.
Content is sourced from contributers by using Twitter as the CMS. 

Sphere of Influence can be set up cost free by exploiting services like GitHub Pages & Heroku. Let the big guys take the burden, they've enough dollar dollar to do it.

# Sphere of Influence (Site)

Sphere of Influence is also the name of the site for which it was developed. Sphere of Influence (the site) is dedicated to tracking lefty news on Twitter with a focus on the United Kingdom. 

We're currently in early development so things will often break and some news may be irrelevant or confusing.

If something is a country level event, eg. affecting the whole UK, a random town will be bestowed the honour of "hosting" the story.
