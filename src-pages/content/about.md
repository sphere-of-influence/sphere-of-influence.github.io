Sphere of Influence is dedicated to tracking Soviet history on Twitter. We are currently in Beta so things might be a little rough & ready.

Current editors are [@SleepingInSnow](//twitter.com/SleepingInSnow) and [@OldNewStandard](//twitter.com/OldNewStandard). If you'd like to join the team please contact either of us. Tweets not from editor accounts will also appear if they are of particular interest.

## Goal

Sphere of Influence aims to spread optimism and awareness of Soviet history.

## How does this work?

Content is ephemeral, meaning only the latest stories from contributors are displayed. For  a partial slice of archived content please 
refer to the individual contributor Twitter feeds.

We're currently in early development so things will often break and some news may be irrelevant or confusing.

We use GitHub Pages for hosting the front-end and Heroku for providing the back-end. Open Layers and Open Street Map provide the mapping interface technology. Chiefly written in JavaScript and Python. There's a little caching going on so we don't max out the Twitter API.

For technical details you can read the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/sphere-of-influence/sphere-of-influence).

## Issues, Inaccuracies or Concerns 
If you've concerns about the content on Sphere of Influence, please contact an editor. All concerns will be promptly addressed.

## Previous Works

Sphere of Influence is a super-light rebuild of a concept originally realised by [@OldNewStandard](//twitter.com/OldNewStandard) with his [Atlaski Project](https://folio.brighton.ac.uk/user/eric-daddio/atlaski-stories-mapped) for the University of Brighton.

## License

Until a robust license can be found which forbids commercial use this code-base remains proprietary and not free for re-use. We're aware this sucks and hope to change the license in future. If you have a suggestion for an appropriate license please contact an editor or contributor.
